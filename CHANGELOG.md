All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- Require **Node 22** (previously Node 20); the updated dependency tree needs Node ≥ 22.19. CI and release workflows, the Dockerfile base image, and `engines` were updated.
- Bump the test runner `vitest` to ^5.0.0.

### Security
- Refresh the dependency tree to clear the moderate `hono` and `qs` advisories (transitive via the MCP SDK's HTTP transport, unused by this stdio server) and the `vitest` advisory; `npm audit` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- Bump `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to ^1.30.0 to clear known dependency advisories flagged by supply-chain scanners.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- MCP **tool annotations** on every tool (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
  `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`), derived from each tool's access
  capability. Hosts can now reason about a tool's safety from structured
  metadata instead of parsing the description — read tools are advertised as
  read-only and non-destructive, admin/destructive tools as mutating.
- A test that keeps the annotations consistent with each tool's capability.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release.
